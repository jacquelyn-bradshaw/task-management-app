# Task Management

Created using React with built in React Context for state management as it is lightweight and scalable for small/medium apps. Structured my css and test files within my component folders for easier access during development and easy to see associated files for other developers.

I would have liked to create a modal for the editing of tasks but it was not achieveable within the time frame. I have kept the CSS basic as I chose to dedicate my time on more complex requirements and functionality.

I would like to work further on this project outside of the task time restrictions and complete the edit functionality, add a Playwright E2E test for the add task journey, tidy up my shared types and improve styling.
